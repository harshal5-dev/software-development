# HTML & CSS Interview Questions

## Introduction
HTML and CSS are fundamental technologies for building web applications. Understanding these technologies is essential for front-end developers as they create user interfaces and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Beginner Level Questions
### 1. What is semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup that conveys meaning about the content within the tags. For example, using `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` tags helps search engines and other user agents understand the structure and importance of the content.

### 2. Explain the box model in CSS.
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content area. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and design in CSS.

## Intermediate Level Questions
### 3. How does CSS specificity work?
CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting rules. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used:
- Inline styles (highest specificity)
- IDs
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
- Elements and pseudo-elements (lowest specificity)

### 4. What are flexbox and its benefits?
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to design a layout structure along a single axis (row or column). It provides powerful alignment capabilities and makes it easier to distribute space among items in a container.

### 5. Describe CSS Grid and its advantages.
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows developers to create complex layouts with rows and columns. It offers greater control over the placement of elements in a layout compared to traditional methods like floats and positioning.

## Advanced Level Questions
### 6. How do you implement responsive design?
Responsive design can be implemented using various techniques, including flexible grid layouts, media queries, and responsive images. It ensures that web applications provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

### 7. Discuss performance optimization techniques for CSS.
Performance optimization techniques for CSS include minimizing CSS file sizes, using shorthand properties, reducing the number of CSS rules, and employing techniques like critical CSS to load essential styles first.

### 8. What are the best practices for web accessibility?
Best practices for web accessibility include using semantic HTML, providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring keyboard navigability, and using sufficient contrast ratios between text and background colors.

### 9. Explain modern CSS features like custom properties (CSS variables) and the `calc()` function.
CSS variables, or custom properties, allow you to store values in a reusable way. The `calc()` function enables you to perform calculations to set CSS property values dynamically. These features enhance the flexibility and maintainability of stylesheets.

## Conclusion
This compilation of HTML and CSS interview questions is designed to help candidates prepare for interviews at leading tech companies. A strong understanding of these concepts is vital for success in front-end development roles.
